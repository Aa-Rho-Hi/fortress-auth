üõ°Ô∏è Fortress Auth ‚Äî Secure Authentication System (.NET 8)
Tech Stack: .NET 8 ‚Ä¢ C# ‚Ä¢ EF Core (SQLite) ‚Ä¢ BCrypt ‚Ä¢ JWT (RS256) ‚Ä¢ OAuth2-style Tokens ‚Ä¢ TOTP MFA ‚Ä¢ Rate Limiting ‚Ä¢ HSTS & Security Headers ‚Ä¢ Docker Support
‚öôÔ∏è Local Setup
# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# 2Ô∏è‚É£ Build in Debug mode
dotnet build -c Debug

# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the API project
dotnet run --project src/FortressAuth.Api
The API will start on https://localhost:5001
and use a development HTTPS certificate generated by .NET.
A default admin account is automatically created on first run:
Email: admin@fortress.local
Password: P@ssw0rd!ChangeMe
‚ö†Ô∏è Change the default password before deploying to production.
üß∞ Configuration Overview
All main settings are in src/FortressAuth.Api/appsettings.json:
JWT issuer, audience, and token lifetime
Database connection string (SQLite by default)
Rate Limiting settings
Admin seed user credentials
RSA key pairs for JWT signing are automatically generated into the keys/ folder (for development).
In production, use secure key management ‚Äî such as AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or HashiCorp Vault.
üß™ Verifying the Setup
Once the server is running, you can test the API with tools like:
curl -X POST https://localhost:5001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"Email":"test@user.com","Password":"Str0ngP@ss!"}'
Or use a browser-based API tester like Insomnia or Postman.
üß± What‚Äôs Next
Enable MFA (TOTP) for your user with /api/auth/enable-mfa
Obtain access tokens via /api/token using OAuth2-style grants
Protect your own endpoints with [Authorize] attributes
Run via Docker for isolated, portable builds:
docker build -t fortress-auth .
docker run -p 8080:8080 fortress-auth
